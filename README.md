This is my AI godot plugin. It is absolutely not production ready and may randomly delete things.

In order to get it working, you currently have to do a few things:

- Create a .api-key file in your project root with your Anthropic API key.
- Create an assets, resources, and scripts folder for the AI to use.
- Add a root node of some kind.
